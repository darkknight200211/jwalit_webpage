<h2 style="margin-left: 35%;"> Plasma Instabilities in Hall Thrusters </h2>

<p style="font-size: 20px; margin-left:1%; margin-right:1%">
    The efficiency of hall-thrusters can be greatly advanced by tackling various
    plasma-instabilities that arise in it. It is found that effective electron-
    transport in Hall-thruster plasma is more than expected from a pure col-
    lisional theory, due to these instabilities. These lead to energy losses that
    could otherwise be used to ionize more of the propellant gas; thus producing
    stronger thrust. In the following report, attempt is made at identifying the
    dominant perturbation wave-modes for two such instabilities, namely Ion
    Acoustic Instability (IAW) and Modified Two-stream Instability (MTSI).
    A detailed derivation of a general 3-D dispersion relation (DR) is presented;
    after this its special cases are shown. MTSI’s dominant modes’ variation
    with temperature is presented in detail. This DR is solved numerically,
    through iterative procedure to identify regions of stability. <br>
